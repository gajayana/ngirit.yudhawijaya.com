- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Transaction Store Enhancements
**File:** `stores/transaction-store.ts`
- **Subscriptions:**
  - `transactions` table - Live CRUD updates
  - `family_members` table - Auto-refresh on family changes
- **Features:**
  - Smart filtering by month and family membership
  - Automatic category data fetching
  - Duplicate detection
  - Optimistic updates

### 3. Auth Store Enhancements
**File:** `stores/auth-store.ts`
- **Subscriptions:**
  - `user_data` table - Role and blocked status changes
- **Features:**
  - Filtered to current user only
  - Console warnings for important changes
  - Automatic initialization on login

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Developers

**1. Enable Realtime in Supabase:**
- Dashboard → Database → Replication
- Enable for: `transactions`, `family_members`, `user_data`

**2. Start Development Server:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**3. Open Multiple Browser Windows:**
- Open http://localhost:3000 in two tabs
- Log in as the same user in both
- Add/edit/delete transactions in one window
- Watch them update instantly in the other window

### For Testing

See `docs/REALTIME_TESTING.md` for detailed testing scenarios.

## 🎯 Benefits

### User Experience
- ✅ **Instant Updates** - No manual refresh needed
- ✅ **Family Collaboration** - See family transactions in real-time
- ✅ **Multi-Tab Sync** - All open tabs stay synchronized
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Changes appear instantly

### Technical
- ✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support
- ✅ **Efficient** - WebSocket-based (no polling)
- ✅ **Filtered** - RLS policies filter server-side
- ✅ **Resilient** - Auto-reconnect and error handling

## 📊 What Gets Synced in Real-Time

| Event | Trigger | What Happens |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Transaction Added** | User adds expense/income | All windows show new transaction instantly |
| **Transaction Edited** | User edits amount/category | All windows update with new data |
| **Transaction Deleted** | User deletes transaction | All windows remove it from list |
| **Family Member Joins** | Admin adds member | All windows refresh member list and transactions |
| **Family Member Leaves** | Admin removes member | All windows update member list |
| **User Role Changed** | Admin changes role | User sees role change in console |
| **User Blocked** | Admin blocks user | User sees block warning in console |

## 🔍 Console Logs

When working correctly, you'll see:

```
🔄 Initializing realtime subscriptions...
✅ Subscribed to transactions
✅ Subscribed to family_members
🔄 Subscribing to user_data changes...
✅ Subscribed to user_data changes
```

When events occur:
```
🔵 Realtime INSERT: abc-123
  ✅ Added to store

🟡 Realtime UPDATE: abc-123
  ✅ Updated in store

🔴 Realtime DELETE: abc-123
  ✅ Removed from store

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family members changed - refreshing...
  ✅ Refreshed family data

👤 User data changed in realtime: { ... }
  🔄 Role changed: user → manager
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Client-Side Only** - Realtime subscriptions only work in browser (not SSR)
2. **RLS Filtered** - You only see events for data you can access (security feature)
3. **No Historical Events** - Realtime only sends new changes, not past data
4. **WebSocket Required** - Requires stable network connection

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### No Realtime Updates?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Realtime enabled in Supabase Dashboard
2. ✅ Console shows "SUBSCRIBED" status
3. ✅ Network tab shows WebSocket connection
4. ✅ Supabase CLI version 2.53.6+

**See:** `docs/REALTIME_TESTING.md` for detailed troubleshooting

## 🎓 Code Examples

### Subscribe to a Table

```typescript
const { subscribe, unsubscribe } = useRealtime();

const channelId = subscribe({
  table: 'transactions',
  event: '*',
  onInsert: (payload) => {
    console.log('New transaction:', payload.new);
  },
  onUpdate: (payload) => {
    console.log('Updated transaction:', payload.new);
  },
  onDelete: (payload) => {
    console.log('Deleted transaction:', payload.old);
  },
  debug: true,
});

// Cleanup
onUnmounted(() => unsubscribe(channelId));
```

### With Filtering

```typescript
subscribe({
  table: 'user_data',
  event: 'UPDATE',
  filter: `user_id=eq.${userId}`,
  onUpdate: (payload) => {
    console.log('Your data changed:', payload.new);
  },
});
```

## ✨ What's Next?

### Possible Future Enhancements
1. Toast notifications for realtime events
2. User presence indicators (who's online)
3. Typing indicators for collaborative editing
4. Optimistic UI updates with rollback
5. Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

### Production Considerations
1. Disable debug logging (`debug: false`)
2. Monitor WebSocket connection health
3. Implement user notifications (toasts/alerts)
4. Track realtime errors in monitoring service

## 🎉 Ready to Test!

Everything is set up and ready. Just:
1. Enable Realtime in Supabase Dashboard
2. Run `pnpm dev`
3. Open multiple browser tabs
4. Start adding/editing transactions
5. Watch the magic happen! ✨
