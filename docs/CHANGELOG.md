### Database Migrations

#### Initial Migrations (5 migrations)

1. **`20240718000001_create_user_data.sql`**: Core user data table
   - user_data table with auto-sync to auth.users
   - Columns: id, email, full_name, role, is_blocked, timestamps
   - Auto-sync triggers: `handle_new_user()`, `handle_user_updated()`
   - SECURITY DEFINER functions to avoid RLS infinite recursion
   - Functions: `is_superadmin()`, `update_user_role()`, `update_user_blocked_status()`

2. **Categories table**: Income/expense categories with soft delete

3. **Currencies table**: Currency definitions with exchange rates

4. **Transactions table**: Financial transactions linked to categories

5. **Assets table**: 12 asset types (cash, savings, investments, crypto, real estate, etc.)

#### Migration Refactoring (Oct 10, 2025)

- ✅ Replaced `user_roles` table → `user_data` table
- ✅ Added `email` column (UNIQUE NOT NULL) with auto-sync from auth.users
- ✅ Added auto-sync triggers
- ✅ Fixed infinite recursion with SECURITY DEFINER functions
- ✅ Consolidated RLS optimizations into base table migrations
- ✅ Verified all migrations free from infinite recursion issues
- ✅ Renamed `utils/constants/role.ts` → `utils/constants/user.ts`
- ✅ Added comprehensive user types: `UserData`, `UserDataInsert`, `UserDataUpdate`
- ✅ Updated all imports across codebase (3 files) to use new `user.ts`

**RLS Optimizations:**

- All policies use `(SELECT auth.uid())` pattern to prevent per-row re-evaluation
- Consolidated policies to avoid multiple permissive policies per action
- SECURITY DEFINER functions for role checks to avoid infinite recursion

### Data Migration System (Phase 1.5 - Oct 10, 2025)

#### Data Organization

- ✅ Created `supabase/data/oldies/` directory structure
- ✅ Moved `spendings_18bulan.sql` → `supabase/data/oldies/`
- ✅ Modified `scripts/firestore.ts` to save to `supabase/data/oldies/expense-firestore.json`

#### MySQL Migration Script (`scripts/mysql.ts`)

- ✅ Read MySQL dump file at `supabase/data/oldies/spendings_18bulan.sql`
- ✅ Parse `tblspending` table data (columns: `ID`, `dt`, `event`, `spending`)
- ✅ Transform to unified JSON format (same structure as Firestore export)
- ✅ Save to `supabase/data/oldies/expense-mysql.json`
- ✅ Show statistics: total records, date range, total value
- ✅ Run with: `pnpm mysql:fetch`
- ✅ Result: 1,055 MySQL records from Aug 9, 2014 - Oct 8, 2015

#### Data Merge Script (`scripts/merge.ts`)

- ✅ Read `supabase/data/oldies/expense-firestore.json`
- ✅ Read `supabase/data/oldies/expense-mysql.json`
- ✅ Combine both datasets into single array
- ✅ Sort by date ascending (oldest first)
- ✅ Keep all records (no deduplication to preserve data integrity)
- ✅ Save to `supabase/data/combined-expense.json`
- ✅ Show merge statistics: Firestore count, MySQL count, final total
- ✅ Run with: `pnpm data:merge`
- ✅ Result: 2,652 total records (1,597 Firestore + 1,055 MySQL)

#### Migration Workflow

1. ✅ Run `pnpm firestore:fetch` → generates `oldies/expense-firestore.json`
2. ✅ Run `pnpm mysql:fetch` → generates `oldies/expense-mysql.json`
3. ✅ Run `pnpm data:merge` → generates `combined-expense.json`
4. ⏭️ Import via UI: Superadmin uploads `combined-expense.json` at `/dashboard/import`
5. ⏭️ Existing import endpoint handles the rest (batch insert, user mapping, etc.)

#### Final Migration Statistics

- Total records: 2,652 expense records
- Date range: Aug 9, 2014 → Oct 10, 2025 (11+ years)
- Total value: Rp 291,770,331
- Ready for import: `supabase/data/combined-expense.json`

#### Initial Migration Features

  - Fetches ALL spendings collection from Firebase Firestore (no pagination limits)
  - Sorted by `created_at` ascending (oldest first)
  - Authentication with Firebase email/password

    - Edit family button (owner only)
    - Delete family button (owner only, soft delete)
  - Mobile-optimized design with 48px+ touch targets

  - No TypeScript `any` usage - all properly typed

#### Family Sharing Key Features

- Family creators automatically promoted to `manager` role
- Family toggle defaults to ON (shows family transactions)
- Server-side family member ID resolution for security
- Date filtering uses `date-fns` with UTC timestamps
- No user attribution shown (privacy-focused design)
- Owner-only permissions (simplified from role hierarchy)

### Known Issues & Investigations

#### Realtime Subscriptions in Local Development (Oct 13, 2025)

- **Issue**: Supabase CLI uses non-JWT keys incompatible with Realtime service
- **Workaround**: Auto-detect local dev and disable realtime (see `stores/transaction-store.ts:438-449`)
- **Status**: ⏳ Under investigation
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added custom `runtimeConfig` in `nuxt.config.ts` for potential service key usage
  - May use service key for realtime in local dev in future
- **Impact**: Manual refresh needed in local dev; works seamlessly in production
- **Note**: Refer to `nuxt.config.ts` for canonical runtime config (not `.env.example`)
